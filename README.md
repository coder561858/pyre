# Pyre – Just Another Graphics Engine

**Pyre** is a lightweight graphics engine built with **OpenGL, GLFW, GLAD, and GLM**, inspired by the concepts and techniques taught in the [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) book.  
It aims to provide a clear, modular, and educational implementation of modern rendering techniques, making it a great project for learning and experimenting with real-time graphics.

## ✨ Features  

- **Core Rendering**: Built on modern OpenGL with GLFW for window/input handling, GLAD for function loading, and GLM for math operations.  
- **Lighting System**: Supports **Phong lighting** with ambient, diffuse, and specular components.  
- **Textures**: Implements **diffuse mapping** for realistic surface rendering.  
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed for continuous development and expansion (e.g., normal mapping, PBR, shadow mapping).  
- **Educational**: Built step by step following LearnOpenGL, making the codebase beginner-friendly for anyone diving into graphics programming.
